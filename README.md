# Market-Sales Inventory in the North Nigeria
### Project Overview

This project was conducted in order to generate deep insight into the Revenue of the shop owners in Marrkets around and in the Northern part of Nigeria over the past Year. We took several analysis on the various parameters in the data of the Pivot Table given below. This is aimed at telling a compelling story around our data based on the information gotten from the data.  So follow me as we dive into the market sales record of a particular region in Nigeria, That is, North west, North-East, and North Central.


### Data sources

The primary data source is from sale.csv, an open source data that can be gotten online from an open source like kaggle, Fred or any other repository site. , Google.com, Data Analysis class, Skillharvest Cohort 3 and other repository sites.


### Tools Used

- Ms Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)

  This is the major tool we used for our analysis, For Cleaning and for PIVOT TABLES
  
- Google Sheet
  
- Pivot Chart
  
- Microsoft Word
  
- PowerBI


### Data Cleaning and Preparation

- Using the Pivot Tables, we were able to summarise the full data of all stores, in different markets in the whole of North Nigeria which is a very large data.
- We also categorised the Units Sold by the shop owners into 3 Categories  for easier Analysis using the IF and IFS condition.
- We also summarised the data to smaller tables Using the PIVOT. 


### Expository Data analysis

We explore the data in the table to answer some questions
1.	The Visual report of the data 
2.	The Revenue per Region
3.	The top 5 Market by Revenue
4.	The top 10 stores by Revenue
5.	Total region by Revenue
6.	Bottom 5 stores by Revenue
7.	Report of Revenue by month
8.	Arrange by region stores and revenue

### Data Analysis

This is where we include some of the basic lines of Codes and queries during the analysis. 

``` MS EXCEL
=IF(Query, [Condition, Value if true, Value if false] 

=IFS(Query,[condition, value if True, Value if False, Else]
```

``` SQL
SELECT* FROM TABLE 1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
